```

#### Build Output
The web build is located at: `build/web/`

#### Deployment Options

**Option A: Firebase Hosting**

npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase in your project
firebase init hosting

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Option B: GitHub Pages**
```bash
# Build with base href for GitHub Pages
flutter build web --release --base-href "/braille-notepad/"

# Copy build/web contents to your gh-pages branch
```

**Option C: Netlify/Vercel**
- Upload the `build/web` folder to Netlify or Vercel
- Set the publish directory to the uploaded folder

#### Web Configuration
- Base URL can be configured via `--base-href` flag

#### Distribution Options

**Option A: Direct Distribution**
- Distribute the entire `build/windows/x64/runner/Release/` folder
- All DLLs and dependencies are included
- Users can run `braille_notepad.exe` directly

**Option B: Installer Creation**
Recommended tool: **Inno Setup** or **NSIS**

Example Inno Setup script:
```inno
[Setup]
AppName=Braille Notepad
AppVersion=1.0.0
DefaultDirName={pf}\Braille Notepad
DefaultGroupName=Braille Notepad
OutputDir=installer_output
OutputBaseFilename=BrailleNotepadSetup

[Files]
Source: "build\windows\x64\runner\Release\*"; DestDir: "{app}"; Flags: recursesubdirs

Name: "{group}\Braille Notepad"; Filename: "{app}\braille_notepad.exe"
Name: "{commondesktop}\Braille Notepad"; Filename: "{app}\braille_notepad.exe"
```

**Option C: Microsoft Store**
- Package using MSIX format
- Requires Windows developer account
- Follow Microsoft's submission guidelines

## Environment Requirements

### Development
- Dart SDK: >=3.0.0 <4.0.0
- Flutter SDK: >=3.0.0
- Windows: Visual Studio Build Tools 2019 (for Windows builds)
- Chrome: For web testing and debugging

### Production
- **Web**: Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Windows**: Windows 10 or later (64-bit)

## Performance Optimizations

### Web Optimizations
```bash
# Build with CanvasKit for better performance
flutter build web --release --web-renderer canvaskit

# Build with HTML renderer for smaller bundle size
flutter build web --release --web-renderer html

# Build with auto renderer (recommended)
flutter build web --release --web-renderer auto
```

### Asset Optimization
- Icon tree-shaking enabled (reduces font assets by 99.4%)
- Only necessary Material and Cupertino icons are included

## Security Considerations

### File Operations
- File save dialogs use native OS dialogs
- User explicitly chooses save location
- No automatic file access without user permission

### Clipboard Operations
- Error handling prevents crashes on clipboard access failures
- User feedback provided for all clipboard operations

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Copy/Paste operations work
- [ ] Clear All function works
- [ ] Responsive layout works on different screen sizes
- [ ] All keyboard shortcuts function properly
- [ ] No console errors in web version
- [ ] Windows executable runs without additional dependencies

## Monitoring and Analytics (Optional)

Consider adding:
- Firebase Analytics for web version
- Sentry for error tracking
- Google Analytics for usage metrics

## Version Management

Current Version: 1.0.0+1

To update version:
1. Edit `pubspec.yaml` - change `version: 1.0.0+1`
2. Increment build number for minor updates
3. Increment version number for major updates

## Rollback Procedure

If issues occur:
1. Keep previous build artifacts
2. Redeploy previous version from backup
3. Document issues for future fix
4. Test fix thoroughly before redeployment

## Support and Documentation

### User Documentation
- Built-in help dialog accessible via help button
- Interactive key mapping guide
- Instructions included in UI

### Technical Support

2. Limited to basic text export (no formatting options)
3. Braille character set limited to English alphabet + basic punctuation
4. No offline storage (web version)

## Future Deployment Enhancements

### Recommended
- [ ] Add CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Implement automated testing on deployment
- [ ] Add deployment environment variables
- [ ] Set up staging environment
- [ ] Add version update notifications
- [ ] Implement crash reporting
- [ ] Add usage analytics
