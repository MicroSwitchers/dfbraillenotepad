## The Fastest Way to Deploy (2 Minutes!)

### Option 1: Automated Setup (Easiest!)

setup-github.bat
```

This will:
1. Configure git with your name/email
2. Add all files to git
3. Create initial commit
4. Set up GitHub remote
5. Push to GitHub

Then follow the on-screen instructions!

#### 2. Push Your Code
```bash
cd "d:\My Code\DartFlutter\Braille Notepad"

# Configure git (one time only)
git config user.name "Your Name"
git config user.email "your@email.com"

# Add and commit
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - Braille Notepad v1.0.0"

# Push to GitHub (replace YOUR_USERNAME)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/braille-notepad.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

#### 3. Enable GitHub Pages
1. Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: **GitHub Actions**

## What's Already Set Up For You

âœ… Git repository initialized
âœ… `.gitignore` configured for Flutter
âœ… GitHub Actions workflow created ([.github/workflows/deploy.yml](.github/workflows/deploy.yml))
âœ… Automatic testing before deployment
âœ… Automatic build and deployment on push
âœ… README updated with live demo link

---

## After First Push

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically:
1. âœ… Run `flutter test` (must pass)
2. âœ… Build web app with correct base URL
3. âœ… Deploy to GitHub Pages
4. âœ… Make your app live!

## Future Updates

Every time you make changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push
```

Your app automatically rebuilds and redeploys! ðŸŽ‰

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can't push - authentication failed?**
- Use a Personal Access Token instead of password
- Go to GitHub Settings â†’ Developer settings â†’ Personal access tokens
- Generate token with `repo` scope
- Use token as password when prompted

**Q: Workflow fails?**
- Check the Actions tab on GitHub for details
- Make sure tests pass locally: `flutter test`
- Check build works locally: `flutter build web`

**Q: Page shows 404?**
- Wait 5 minutes after first deployment
- Check Settings â†’ Pages is set to "GitHub Actions"
- Verify URL includes repo name: `/braille-notepad/`
