## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk Areas ✓
- Core Braille input logic (well-tested, isolated controller)
- UI rendering (BraillePaper, BrailleCell components)
- State management (ChangeNotifier pattern)
- Keyboard event handling

### Medium Risk Areas ⚠
- File system operations (now mitigated with error handling)
- Clipboard access (now mitigated with error handling)
- Cross-platform compatibility (tested on Windows and Web)

### Mitigated Risks
1. **File Save Failures**: Now caught and reported to user with retry option
2. **Clipboard Permission Denials**: Now handled gracefully with user feedback
3. **Small Screen Rendering**: Fixed overflow issues in dialogs
4. **Empty Clipboard**: Detected and reported clearly to user

## Code Architecture Stability

### Strengths
1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
   - Input logic: [braille_input.dart](lib/braille_input.dart)
   - Display logic: [braille_paper.dart](lib/braille_paper.dart)
   - Main UI: [braille_notepad.dart](lib/braille_notepad.dart)

2. **Reactive State Management**
   - Single source of truth (BrailleInputController)
   - ListenableBuilder for efficient updates
   - Proper disposal of resources

3. **Responsive Design**
   - LayoutBuilder for adaptive layouts
   - Dynamic padding based on screen size
   - Constrained widths for optimal viewing

### Areas for Future Enhancement
1. **Persistence**: Add local storage for auto-save
2. **Extended Character Set**: More Braille characters and symbols
3. **Undo/Redo**: History management for editing
4. **Accessibility**: Screen reader integration improvements
5. **Testing**: Add integration tests for complex user flows

## Performance Analysis

### Web Performance
- Initial bundle size: Optimized with tree-shaking
- Font assets: 99.4% reduction through tree-shaking
- Rendering: Smooth 60fps on modern browsers
- Load time: Fast initial load with minimal dependencies

### Windows Performance
- Launch time: Near-instant on modern hardware

3. ✓ Create user documentation (built-in help available)

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
1. Monitor for user-reported issues
2. Track file save success/failure rates (if analytics added)
3. Collect feedback on Braille character set completeness
4. Monitor performance on various devices

### Future Enhancements (Non-Critical)
1. Add auto-save functionality
2. Implement undo/redo system
3. Expand Braille character mappings
4. Add customizable key bindings
5. Implement dark/light theme toggle
6. Add export format options (PDF, HTML)

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **Platform Support**: Web and Windows only (Android/iOS disabled)
2. **Character Set**: Limited to basic English Braille + punctuation
3. **Storage**: No automatic persistence (user must export)
4. **Formatting**: Plain text export only
5. **Multi-language**: English Braille only

These limitations are intentional design decisions and do not impact stability for the intended use case.

## Conclusion
